# Sirio-Network_API-Client
Raw Sockets Python and Websockets Javascript Clients for the Sirio Network API

## Documentation will be later available.

### Usage

**Rawsockets Client**
- Simply run SNAPI_RSC.py, the Rawsockets Shell will then launch and by default connect to the Trinity Relay.
- You may get a list of commands with "help".
- This file may also be used as a module and allows finer control.


**Rawsockets Module**
- Import SNAPI_CM.py and then use the SirioAPI function.
- This file is mostly only used by the Trinity Relay itself (for forwarding requests), it only sends a full on request (sends then receive, nothing else).


**Websockets Client**
- Run Sirio-Network_API-Client.html in your webbrowser.
